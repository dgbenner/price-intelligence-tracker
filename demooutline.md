# Price Intelligence Tracker - Demo Bullet Points

## What
- Historical price tracking for medical necessities and chronic condition supplies
- Monitors niche products subject to demand and urgency pricing
- Reveals true value through data transparency

## Why
- Medical product pricing exploits urgency and lack of transparency
- Chronic conditions mean repeated purchases over years
- Current systems create information asymmetry favoring sellers
- Dollar-cost averaging opportunities hidden from consumers

## Demo Visuals
- Price history charts for eczema/dermatitis products (your case study)
- Fluctuation patterns over time
- Calculated savings on single purchase vs. urgent buying
- Year-over-year exponential savings projection
- Compare "buy now" urgency pricing vs. informed patience

## Next
- Cloud deployment for 24/7 monitoring (PythonAnywhere)
- Expanding to other chronic condition products
- Building broader economic impact calculations

# Sample Script with Visuals

**[DASHBOARD showing price history chart for eczema cream]**

"This is a price intelligence tracker for medical necessities—specifically products for chronic conditions like eczema and dermatitis."

**[Highlight price fluctuations over time]**

"Niche medical products use demand-based and urgency pricing. There's no true price transparency, and consumers have no leverage."

**[Show savings calculation on screen]**

"By tracking historical prices, you can identify actual value and practice dollar-cost averaging instead of panic buying."

**[Display year-over-year savings projection]**

"For chronic conditions requiring ongoing purchases, the savings compound exponentially year after year."

**[Return to dashboard view]**

"This isn't just cost savings—it's agency. It shifts the mental model from 'buy now' urgency to informed, data-driven purchasing decisions."

**[Show one more product example]**

"Next steps include cloud deployment for continuous monitoring and expanding coverage to other chronic condition supplies."

The power here is the **agency narrative**—not just "save money" but "combat exploitative pricing through information symmetry." Your personal case study grounds it in reality.
